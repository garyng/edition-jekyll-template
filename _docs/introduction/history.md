C#, pronounced as "see-sharp" {% cite Kovacs2007 --prefix history %}, is a multi-paradigm programing language that was developed by Microsoft around year 2000 under, and is still under, the lead of the prominent Danish software engineer – Anders Hejlsberg {% cite Microsoft2006 --prefix history %}.

The design of the language is heavily influenced by `C++` and `Java` {% cite Naugler2007 --prefix history %} during its infancy but had embarked on an increasingly divergent journey since then.

Throughout the almost 18 years of development, C# has gone through many major versions {% cite Microsoft2017 --prefix history %} – currently sitting at version 7.3, with version 8.0 at the bleeding edge of prerelease.

## Why C# is invented?

The most plausible motivation for Microsoft creating a new language that is so similar to Java back then probably rooted in the _“Sun Microsystems v. Microsoft Corporation”_ lawsuit {% cite Shankland2002 --prefix history %}. 

As the settlement of the case, Microsoft was forced to discontinue its proprietary **Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM)** – an attempt of the giant to drive more customers to use Windows and Microsoft products (under the internally-used _“Embrace, extend, and extinguish”_ slogan {% cite Economist2000 --prefix history %}). 

Eventually, C# was born, “which was not intended to needle Sun” but “with that as a side effect” to Sun {% cite Wong2000 --prefix history %}.

## Side note

The “sharp” in C# should be the sharp symbol “♯” – however the hash symbol “#” is chosen as the close approximate because the sharp symbol is not present on most keyboard layouts {% cite MSDN2006 --prefix history %}.

Besides from being inspired by musical notation {% cite Kovacs2007 --prefix history %}, the name of C# can also be viewed as a ligature of four plus symbols arranged in a two-by-two grid, implying its close relation to both C and C++ as a form of “increment” to the former two {% cite Hamilton2008 --prefix history %}.
