Selection statements are used for transferring the program control to a specific flow based on the result of some conditional expressions (which return either `true` or `false`) {% cite Docs2015j --prefix selection-statements %}.

In C# exists mainly 2 types of selection statement:

1. [if statements (two-way selectors)]({% link _docs/05-control-structures/if-statements.md %})
1. [switch statements (multiple-way selectors)]({% link _docs/05-control-structures/switch-statements.md %})
