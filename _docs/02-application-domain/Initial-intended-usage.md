As stated in the first edition of C# Language Specification (EMCA-334):

> - C# is intended to be a simple, modern, **general-purpose**, object-oriented programming language.
>
> - C# is intended to be suitable for writing applications for both **hosted** and **embedded systems**, ranging from the very large that use sophisticated operating systems, down to the very small having dedicated functions.

Thus it is apparent that C# is designed to be used in literally any application domain (if performance consideration is not taken into account).

Albeit its versatility, C# has mainly been used for developing commercial applications including:

1. business applications
1. web applications

In fact, almost the entire .NET framework is written in C# {% cite jasonall2008 --prefix initial-usages %}
