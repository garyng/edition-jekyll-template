C# is designed to be used in literally **any** application domain

{% fragment %} but has mainly been used for developing _commercial_ applications

---

including

1. business applications {% fragment %}
1. web applications {% fragment %}

---

## As stated in the first edition of C# Language Specification

## (EMCA-334)

---

C# is intended to be a

- simple {% fragment %}
- modern {% fragment %}
- general-purpose {% fragment %}

{% fragment %} object-oriented programming language

---

## and

be suitable for writing applications for

- hosted {% fragment %}
- embedded {% fragment %}

{% fragment %} systems

---

## in fact

almost the entire `.NET framework` is written in C#

---

# What types of applications

## is the language _actually_ being used mostly?

---

## desktop applications

using various technologies like

- WinForms (Windows Forms) {% fragment %}
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) {% fragment %}

---

## web sites, web applications and web services

primarily using ASP.NET

---

# WinForms

## or _Windows Forms_

{% fragment %} graphical class library included as a part of Microsoft .NET Framework

---

its popularity can be seen though the large amount of commercially-available

However, WinForms is now in

## maintenance mode {% fragment %}

no new features will be added {% fragment %}

---

Developers are also advised to move forward to its successor

## the XAML based UI frameworks {% fragment %}

like WPF and UWP {% fragment %}

---

even though WinForms is nearly

## {% fragment %} _“dead”_

{% fragment %} there are still a lot of **legacy** WinForms applications in **production** till this date

---

# WPF

## Windows Presentation Foundation

Almost all of the newer .NET desktop applications are written using WPF {% fragment %}

---

for example:

1. Microsoft Visual Studio {% fragment %}
1. Expression Blend (for designing XAML-based interfaces) {% fragment %}

---

and a lot more:

1. Autodesk AutoCAD
1. Nero
1. Lenovo ThinkVantage
1. HP Total Care Advisor
1. Intel Rapid Storage Technology
1. AMD Fusion Media Explorer
1. Nokia Music

---

the language itself still

## evolving continuously

which gained even more traction with the open source of .NET

the C# (and Visual Basic) compiler

## Roslyn

is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn)

--

## C# language specification

is also open source at [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang)

where everyone can suggest ideas and make improvements to the language

---

# Where

## C# is used?

---

1. Game development
1. Mobile development {% fragment %}
1. Cross-platform development {% fragment %}
1. Artificial Intelligence {% fragment %}
1. ... etc {% fragment %}

---

The end.
