A name is a string of characters used to identify some entity in a program. C# imposes no limit on the length of names and all characters are significant (meaning that they are case sensitive).

However, identifiers in C# must obey the following rules {% cite Jones2001 --prefix names %}

1. starts with either
    1. letters, or
    1. underscore character
1. contains only
    1. letters
    1. digits
    1. underscore character
1. must not be a keyword or a reserved word (which can be “escaped” by prefixing with the `@` verbatim character)
