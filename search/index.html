						"content": "There are some unique features of C# that make itself stand out from the sheer amount of programming languages in the wild. Support for Property syntax Partial classes and methods Extension methods Anonymous types Language Integrated Query (LINQ) are some of the prominent ones. Property syntax Property syntax allow classes to provide a flexible mechanism for getting, setting, or computing the value of a private field (Docs, 2017). public class SaleItem { public string Name { get; set; } public decimal Price { get; set; } } Partial classes and methods Partial classes and methods allow a class’s members to be defined in multiple files (Docs, 2015) which provide the following benefits: multiple programmers to work on the same class at the same time provide a mechanism to extend a compiler generated code File1 public partial class Employee { public void DoWork() { } partial method partial void onNameChanged(); } File2 public partial class Employee { public void GoToLunch() { } partial void onNameChanged() { method body } } Extension methods Extension method is a statically-defined method that also allows programmers to extend the functionality of a class that cannot be modified, such as the built-in types. public static class StringExtension { extend the built in string type public static int WordCount(this string str) { return str.Split(new char[] {' ', '.','?'}, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length; } } Anonymous types Anonymous type provide a simpler way to encapsulate a set of read only property into a single object and it is not necessary to define a type first. The type name is generated by compiler (Docs, 2015). var v = new { Amount = 108, Message = \"Hello\" }; Console.WriteLine(v.Amount + v.Message); Language Integrated Query (LINQ) Language Integrated Query (LINQ) provide a unified language for querying data from various data source including XML documents, SQL databases, ADO.NET datasets, .NET collections or any other format provided that a LINQ provider is available (Docs, 2015) Query syntax var result = from student in students where student.Scores[0] &gt; 90 select student; Fluent syntax var result = students.Where(student =&gt; student.Scores[0] &gt; 90); References Docs, M.

						"content": "C#, pronounced as “see-sharp” (Kovacs, 2007), is a multi-paradigm programing language that was developed by Microsoft around year 2000 under, and is still under, the lead of the prominent Danish software engineer – Anders Hejlsberg (Microsoft, 2006). The design of the language is heavily influenced by C++ and Java (Naugler, 2007) during its infancy but had embarked on an increasingly divergent journey since then. Throughout the almost 18 years of development, C# has gone through many major versions (Microsoft, 2017) – currently sitting at version 7.3, with version 8.0 at the bleeding edge of prerelease. Why C# is invented? The most plausible motivation for Microsoft creating a new language that is so similar to Java back then probably rooted in the “Sun Microsystems v. Microsoft Corporation” lawsuit (Shankland, 2002). As the settlement of the case, Microsoft was forced to discontinue its proprietary Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM) – an attempt of the giant to drive more customers to use Windows and Microsoft products (under the internally-used “Embrace, extend, and extinguish” slogan (Economist, 2000)). Eventually, C# was born, “which was not intended to needle Sun” but “with that as a side effect” to Sun (Wong, 2000). Side note The “sharp” in C# should be the sharp symbol “♯” – however the hash symbol “#” is chosen as the close approximate because the sharp symbol is not present on most keyboard layouts (MSDN, 2006). Besides from being inspired by musical notation (Kovacs, 2007), the name of C# can also be viewed as a ligature of four plus symbols arranged in a two-by-two grid, implying its close relation to both C and C++ as a form of “increment” to the former two (Hamilton, 2008).

						"content": "C# supports more than one programming style: Imperative programming Procedural programming Object-oriented programming Functional programming etc.. Such language is better known as a “multi-paradigm” programming language. Procedural programming Procedural language describes the sequence of statement step by step to reach the goal (Hope, 2017). It tells the computer how to accomplish a task by breaking down a problem into multiple, smaller sub tasks. Here is an example function for calculating the total amount of payment adapted from (Lilly, 2016). public void CalculateTotalAmount() { Get all the orders InventoryItem book = new InventoryItem(1, \"Learn C# in 30 Minutes\", InventoryItem.SalesTaxCategory.Normal, (decimal)19.95, (decimal)2.5); InventoryItem ebook = new InventoryItem(2, \"Learn F# in 31 Minutes\", InventoryItem.SalesTaxCategory.Normal, (decimal)9.95, 0); InventoryItem energyDrink = new InventoryItem(3, \"Monster Energy Drink\", InventoryItem.SalesTaxCategory.Food, (decimal)1.95, (decimal)0.75); Get customer Customer joe = new Customer(1, \"Joe Smith\", false); Create an order Order order = new Order(1, joe); order.LineItems.Add(new LineItem(book, 2)); order.LineItems.Add(new LineItem(ebook, 1)); order.LineItems.Add(new LineItem(energyDrink, 10)); Rates const decimal normalTaxRate = (decimal)0.08; const decimal medicineTaxRate = (decimal)0.00; const decimal foodTaxRate = (decimal)0.04; const decimal luxuryTaxRate = (decimal)0.14; decimal subTotal = (decimal)0.0; decimal tax = (decimal)0.0; decimal shippingFee = (decimal)0.0; Calculate sub total based on category foreach(LineItem lineItem in order.LineItems) { decimal lineItemSubTotal = lineItem.Item.Price * lineItem.Quantity; subTotal += lineItemSubTotal; if(lineItem.Item.TaxCategory == InventoryItem.SalesTaxCategory.Medicine) { tax += lineItemSubTotal * medicineTaxRate; } else if(lineItem.Item.TaxCategory == InventoryItem.SalesTaxCategory.Food) { tax += lineItemSubTotal * foodTaxRate; } else if(lineItem.Item.TaxCategory == InventoryItem.SalesTaxCategory.Luxury) { tax += lineItemSubTotal * luxuryTaxRate; } else Normal { tax += lineItemSubTotal * normalTaxRate; } if(!order.Customer.IsPremiumMember) { Non-Premium customers pay 50 cents per pound for shipping. shippingFee += lineItem.Item.Weight * lineItem.Quantity * (decimal)0.50; } } Calculate total decimal total = subTotal + tax + shippingFee; System.Console.WriteLine(subTotal); System.Console.WriteLine(tax); System.Console.WriteLine(shippingFee); System.Console.WriteLine(total); } Object-oriented programming C# also supports object-oriented programming, where a problem domain is model using “objects” which may contain data and behaviors. The same example, but the business logic is moved to the Order class. public void CalculateTotalAmount() { InventoryItem book = new InventoryItem(1, \"Learn C# in 30 Minutes\", InventoryItem.SalesTaxCategory.Normal, (decimal)19.95, (decimal)2.5); InventoryItem ebook = new InventoryItem(2, \"Learn F# in 31 Minutes\", InventoryItem.SalesTaxCategory.Normal, (decimal)9.95, 0); InventoryItem energyDrink = new InventoryItem(3, \"Monster Energy Drink\", InventoryItem.SalesTaxCategory.Food, (decimal)1.95, (decimal)0.75); Customer joe = new Customer(1, \"Joe Smith\", false); Create an order Order order = new Order(1, joe); order.LineItems.Add(new LineItem(book, 2)); order.LineItems.Add(new LineItem(ebook, 1)); order.LineItems.Add(new LineItem(energyDrink, 10)); Check values. Notice that nothing needs to be calculated in this code. All values are calculated in the business classes. System.Console.WriteLine(order.SubTotal); System.Console.WriteLine(order.Tax); System.Console.WriteLine(order.ShippingFee); System.Console.WriteLine(order.Total); } Functional programming Functional language is a programming language built over and around logical functions or procedures within its programming structure. For example, a LINQ query: database.Where(item =&gt; item.Customer.Name == \"Joe\") .Select(item =&gt; item.CalculatePrice()) .Aggregate(0, (accumulate, price) =&gt; accumulate + price); References Hope, C.

Its popularity can be seen though the sheer amount of commercially-available custom user interface controls: DevExpress WinForms Windows Forms UI Controls by Infragistics Syncfusion Essential Studio for Windows Forms Xceed for WinForms Telerik UI for WinForms … and lots more However, WinForms is now in maintenance mode as no new features will be added (Allen, 2014). Developers are also advised to move forward to its successor – the XAML based UI frameworks, like WPF and UWP. One thing to note is that even if WinForms is nearly “dead”, there are still a lot of legacy WinForms applications in production till this date (Corey, 2018; Heath, 2014). WPF Almost all of the newer .NET desktop applications are written using WPF, some of the notable examples are: Microsoft Visual Studio Expression Blend, for designing XAML-based interfaces and a lot more, compiled from (StackOverflow, 2011): Autodesk AutoCAD Nero Lenovo ThinkVantage HP Total Care Advisor Intel Rapid Storage Technology AMD Fusion Media Explorer Nokia Music HP TouchSmart … ASP.NET ASP.NET is an open-source (Microsoft, 2017) framework for building modern web apps and services with .NET.

The way to measure the popularity of a programming language is by examining the job demand because it reflects what the industries are searching for. Below shows the most in-demand languages of the end of the year 2017 (Putano, 2017). As we can see that C# is the 3rd most popular languages from the job websites, signifying its weight in Line of Business applications. According to Glassdoor, the average C# developer salary, as of April 2018 in the United States, was $79,954. The range extended from $61,000 to a high of $104,000 per annum (Glassdoor, 2018). Beside from the career prospects and the salary expectations, we can also analyze the number of users of using each language programming languages from GitHub. Here, GitHub is the most suitable choice of data sources because as of June 2018, GitHub reported to have over 30 million users (GitHub, 2018) and 57 million repositories (Firestine, 2017), making it one of the largest host of source code in the world (Gousios, Vasilescu, Serebrenik, &amp; Zaidman, 2018). Below shows the overall rankings for each language (Frederickson, 2018), we can see that C# is the 7th most used programming language. Why so many people are using C#? the mature ecosystem surrounding C#, including the greatest IDE of all: Microsoft Visual Studio, which also offers a free version - Microsoft Visual Studio Community a Mac version - Microsoft Visual Studio for Mac and even a lightweight, cross-platform version - Visual Studio Code .NET Framework, and the vast libraries offered by the framework .NET Core, the open source and cross platform version of .NET Framework C# has a small learning curve (Mashable, 2018) C# is very versatile for developing a multitude of different applications, including Desktop apps WinForms WPF UWP Web servers and clients ASP.NET ASP.NET Core Mobile apps Xamarin Games Unity the language itself still evolving continuously, which gained even more traction with the open source of .NET Roslyn, the C# (and Visual Basic) compiler is open source on GitHub C# language specification is also open source at GitHub, where everyone can suggest ideas and make improvements to the language Where C# is used? C# is used in mainly business domain including desktop and web application as stated before (Current Usage of C#). Recently, C# is also getting more and more attention in the following areas: Game development Unity Mobile development Xamarin Cross-platform development .NET Core Xamarin Mono Artificial Intelligence Azure AI Platform ML.NET References Putano, B.

For example, conversions from smaller to larger integral types from derived classes to base classes from smaller to larger integral types int num1 = 10; double num2 = num1; from derived classes to base classes Derived d = new Derived(); Base b = d; Explicit type conversion Casting is required when information might be lost in the conversion, which is also known as a narrowing conversion.
